    <p>
        Suppose that you picked 10 and other participants in your group picked
        20, 20, 10, 30. The average of all chosen numbers is 18. Which number
        did the winner pick and what would be your payoff?
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b> The winners picked <b>10</b>
        and your payoff would be <b>50 points</b>.
    </p>

    <p>

        Explanation: The average of all chosen numbers was (10+20+20+10+30)/5=18
        as given. Two-third of 18 was 18/3*2=12. 10 was the closest
        chosen number to 12. Thus you and the otherparticipant who picked it
        were the winners. Each of you would receive <b>50 points</b>.
